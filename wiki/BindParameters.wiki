BIRT parameter handling in DataSets presents a few challenges.  Particularly when working with multi-select parameters.  This function simplifies the use of parameters in BIRT ODA DataSets.  You will no longer need to bind your parameters on a separate tab, and using multi-select parameters is as easy as writing
{{{
select * from customers 
where 0=0 
/* BIND and state in ($param_states) */
}}}
