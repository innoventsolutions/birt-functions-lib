Returns the running sum of a given field, using decimal calculations.
The only parameter is the field that holds the values you wish to use.
This is a running aggregation, which means you should use it on the same grouping level as the field specified, usually detail.
It will change the return data type to DECIMAL.

This function is an alternative for the built-in RUNNINGSUM aggregation.  
It will avoid minutae that sometimes occur in floating point calculations.
