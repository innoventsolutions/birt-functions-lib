Returns the running NPV (net present value) of a given field, using decimal calculations.
The first parameter is the field that holds the values you wish to use.
The second parameter is the rate.
This is a running aggregation, which means you should use it on the same grouping level as the field specified, usually detail.
It will change the return data type to DECIMAL.

This function is an alternative for the built-in QUARTILE aggregation.  
It will avoid minutae that sometimes occur in floating point calculations.
