#sidebar sidebar

Allows a developer to programmatically add a !ReportItem in a library to the end of a report design.  
A report developer could achieve the same effect by dragging and dropping a control into a report.  
The down-side to the drag and drop mechanism is that once an item is in a report, there is a chance the
!ReportItem can be over-written by other developers.  If this happens the inheritance from the library may be compromised.

Using this technique, report developers can quickly add boiler plate disclaimers to the end of any report.  This script function
should be called in the !BeforeFactory or !OnPrepare method of the report.
