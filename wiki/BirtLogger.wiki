Adding logging to your BIRT report can be difficult.  This function gives report developers access to the 
commons.logging framework from within their BIRT Script.  Using this technique your report developers can use a
standard logging framework within their BIRT !JavaScript. 

Adding the following statements to your report in a script or expression builder will cause the following messages to 
show up in your commons logging output formats.  

{{{
CustomFunctions.BirtLogger("My Message");
CustomFunctions.BirtLogger("My Warning Message", "WARNING");
}}} 

Results in the following text getting directed to the console.  
If logging is configured to print to a file, then these messages would be sent to the file.
{{{
Sep 29, 2009 3:43:14 PM innovent.birt.functions.BirtLogger execute
INFO: java.lang.String: My Message
Sep 29, 2009 3:43:14 PM innovent.birt.functions.BirtLogger execute
WARNING: java.lang.String: My Warning Message
}}}
