== Aggregates ==
Aggregate functions are performed across a collection of rows.  Aggregate extensions show up in the Aggregate Builder and behave like the built-in BIRT Aggregates (e.g. Count, Sum..._)  Custom aggregates support all of the grouping and filtering options that the standard aggregates support.
