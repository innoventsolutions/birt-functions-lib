There are two types of extensions in this project, Aggregates and Script Functions.  

== Aggregates ==
Aggregate functions are performed across a number of rows.  Aggregate extensions show up in the Aggregate Editor and fully support all of the grouping and filtering options that the standard aggregates support.
=== ConcatenateUnique ===
=== CountUnique ===

== Script Functions ==
Script functions show up in the report designer in any of the locations where BIRT supports code assist.
