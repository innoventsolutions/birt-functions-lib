There are two types of extensions in this project, Aggregates and Script Functions.  

== Aggregates ==
Aggregate functions are performed across a number of rows.  Aggregate extensions show up in the Aggregate Editor and fully support all of the grouping and filtering options that the standard aggregates support.
=== ConcatenateUnique ===
=== CountUnique ===

== Script Functions ==
Script functions show up in the report designer in any of the locations where BIRT supports code assist.  The functions from this library show up in a Category named Custom Functions.

=== AppendLibraryContent === Use script to add Library Report Items to your report.
=== BindParameters === Simplifies the BIRT SQL parameters.  Great for multi-selects.
=== BirtLogger === Standard mechanism to log from your script files.
=== DisplayParameters === Shows all their parameters and values, great for report debug.
=== SetChartPalette === Use CSS to control the chart palette.
=== TextWrap === Wrap text to specified length.
=== ThrowException === Allow your script to generate error messages that show in the report.
